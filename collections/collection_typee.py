# Collection Types

# any object that contains zero or more member objects (elements) are known as collections

# 3 main categories
# Sequences
# Maps
# Sets

# Type          Class       Category        Kind            Mutable
# range         range       sequences       non-primitive   no
# tuple         tuple       sequences       non-primitive   no
# list          list        sequences       non-primitive   yes
# dictionary    dict        maps            non-primitive   yes
# set           set         sets            non-primitive   yes
# frozen set    frozenset   sets            non-primitive   no
# strings       str         text sequences  primitive       no

# text sequences are essentially just strings
# it's important to note that they are not collections
# but they share the same characteristics as collections

# understand which collections are mutable and not
