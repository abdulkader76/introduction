# 3. Identify at least 2 differences between lists and tuples.

# lists are mutable - tuples are immutable
# since tuples are immutable, Python uses them for space-savings and performance optimization, lists are limited in this capability


# Identify at least 2 ways that lists and tuples are similar

# lists and tuples are ordered collections - meaning the values are indexed in a sequential manner - first item is indexed at 0, second item indexed at 1, and so on

# lists and tuples are heterogenous - they can multiple objects

# Differences
#     Lists are mutable; tuples are immutable.
#     List literals use []; tuple literals use ().
# Similarities
#     Lists and tuples are both sequences. Sequences are ordered collections that can use numeric indexes to access the members.
#     Lists and tuples are heterogeneous; elements do not need to all be the same type.
