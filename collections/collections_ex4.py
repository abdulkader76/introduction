# 4. Why can we treat strings as sequences?

# ans:
# Strings behave similarly to collections - where the each character is indexed similarly to collection - starting with 0, 1, 2, 3 and so on.

# Strings are also iterable, the same way as collections.

# launchschool solution:
# Strings are ordered; you can access the individual characters with indexing.
